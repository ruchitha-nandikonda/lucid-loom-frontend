# What I Can Help You With

## ✅ Things I CAN Do:

1. **Check your setup:**
   - Verify if backend is running
   - Check if API key is configured
   - Check database status
   - Verify file structure

2. **Fix code issues:**
   - Fix bugs in the codebase
   - Add new features
   - Improve error handling
   - Update documentation

3. **Create helper scripts:**
   - Setup scripts
   - Diagnostic tools
   - Automation scripts

4. **Troubleshoot:**
   - Debug errors
   - Check logs
   - Verify configurations

## ❌ Things I CANNOT Do:

1. **Access your OpenAI account:**
   - I can't log into OpenAI for you
   - I can't create API keys for you
   - I can't see your API key

2. **Access your computer directly:**
   - I can't open files in your editor
   - I can't click buttons for you
   - I can't restart services automatically

3. **Know your API key:**
   - You need to get it from OpenAI
   - You need to add it to `.env` yourself
   - It's sensitive information only you should handle

## 🎯 What You Need to Do:

**To set up the API key, you need to:**

1. **Go to OpenAI website yourself:**
   - Visit: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Sign in with your account
   - Create a new key
   - Copy it

2. **Add it to your project:**
   - Edit `dream-backend/.env`
   - Paste your key
   - Save the file

3. **Restart backend:**
   - Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
   - Start it again

**I can guide you through each step, but you need to do the actual setup!**
