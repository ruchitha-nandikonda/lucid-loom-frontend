# 🎨 Realistic Image Generation

## What Changed:

The image generation prompt has been updated to create **realistic, photorealistic images** instead of surreal/artistic ones.

### Before:
- Surreal, dreamy, artistic style
- Gentle, abstract scenes

### After:
- **Realistic, photorealistic style**
- Natural lighting
- Real-world settings
- Lifelike details
- Looks like a real photograph

## How It Works:

When you create or regenerate a dream:
1. AI analyzes your dream text
2. Creates an `image_prompt` describing a realistic scene
3. DALL-E 3 generates a photorealistic image
4. Image appears in your dream

## To See Realistic Images:

### For New Dreams:
- Just create a new dream - it will automatically get a realistic image

### For Existing Dreams:
- Click the **🔄 Regenerate** button on any dream card
- Wait 30 seconds
- The new realistic image will appear

## Example:

**Dream:** "I was walking through a forest"

**Old Style:** Surreal, dreamy forest with magical elements

**New Style:** Realistic photograph of an actual forest path with natural lighting
