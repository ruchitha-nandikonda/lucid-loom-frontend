# 💳 When Will You Be Charged?

## ⚡ Charges Happen Immediately (But Billed Later)

### How It Works:

1. **You use the API** → Charges accumulate in real-time
2. **Charges are tracked** → Added to your account balance
3. **Billing happens** → Usually monthly or when you hit a threshold

---

## 📅 Billing Cycle

### Standard Billing:
- **Monthly billing:** Charges appear on your credit card at the end of each month
- **Or threshold billing:** If you hit a certain amount (e.g., $50), you might be billed immediately

### Example Timeline:
```
Day 1: Create 10 dreams = $0.40 charged to account
Day 5: Create 20 more = $0.80 more = $1.20 total
Day 15: Create 30 more = $1.20 more = $2.40 total
...
End of Month: Credit card charged $2.40
```

## 🔔 How to Get Notified

### 1. **Set Up Usage Alerts** (Recommended!)

Go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits

**Set alerts for:**
- When you reach $5 spent
- When you reach $10 spent
- When you reach $20 spent
- Custom amounts

**You'll get:**
- Email notifications
- Dashboard notifications
- Can set multiple alert thresholds

### 2. **Set Spending Limits**

**Hard Limit:**
- Set maximum monthly spending (e.g., $10/month)
- API will **stop working** when limit is reached
- Prevents unexpected charges

**Soft Limit (Alert Only):**
- Get notified but API continues working
- Good for monitoring without blocking

### 3. **Check Usage Dashboard**

Go to: https://platform.openai.com/usage

**See:**
- Real-time spending
- Usage by model
- Daily/weekly/monthly breakdown
- Projected monthly cost
